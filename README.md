# covid19-wk8
a simple data analysis notebook
#  Global COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic using real-world data. It tracks global trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations, and provides insights using Python data tools and visualizations.

---

##  Objectives

- ‚úÖ Import and clean COVID-19 data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus)
- ‚úÖ Analyze time trends of cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- ‚úÖ Compare statistics across selected countries (e.g., Kenya, USA, India)
- ‚úÖ Visualize trends with line charts, bar graphs, and choropleth maps
- ‚úÖ Communicate findings in a clear and insightful report format

---

##  Dataset

- **Source:** [OWID COVID-19 Dataset (CSV)](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv)
- **Columns Used:**  
  `date`, `location`, `total_cases`, `new_cases`, `total_deaths`, `total_vaccinations`, `people_fully_vaccinated`, `population`

---

##  Features & Visualizations

- **Line charts**: Total cases, new daily cases, death rates
- **Bar charts**: Vaccination percentage comparisons
- **Choropleth map**: Total cases by country (optional, interactive with Plotly)
- **Markdown insights**: Summary of findings in notebook narrative

## üîç How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook/script.
2. Install dependencies (optional via `requirements.txt`):
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
    ```
3. Run the notebook:

##  Example Insights

-  India and USA recorded significantly higher total cases than Kenya.
-  The USA had the fastest full vaccination rollout among selected countries.
-  Death rates showed notable spikes in mid-2021, especially in the USA.
-  Global case distribution can be visualized using an interactive choropleth map.
